Graph-wise Possible Insights:
1. Repository Numbers vs Followers (Scatter Plot)
 Possible Insights:

Users with more repositories tend to have more followers — but not always linearly.

Some users with few repositories still have high followers — meaning quality over quantity.

Outliers may show "famous" developers with few but powerful projects.

2. Joining Year vs Repository Numbers (Scatter Plot)
 Possible Insights:

Users who joined earlier (like 2010–2015) tend to have more repositories — they had more time to create projects.

Newer users (joined after 2020) might have fewer repositories.

You might see a steady growth of repositories over time.

3. Followers vs Stars (Scatter Plot)
 Possible Insights:

Users with more followers also tend to have more stars on their repositories.

A few users might have many stars despite low followers — maybe because of a popular open-source project.

Some "high followers but low stars" users could be managers, writers, or other tech community figures (not necessarily coders).

4. Last Year Contributions vs Followers (Scatter Plot)
Possible Insights:

More active contributors (lots of commits, pull requests) tend to have more followers.

It could show community engagement matters for gaining recognition.

If no correlation is seen: maybe only big events (like trending projects) matter more than daily contribution.

5. Programming Language vs Followers (Box Plot)
 Possible Insights:

Developers using popular languages like Python, JavaScript, or Java might have higher median followers.

Less popular languages (e.g., Perl, Haskell) might show lower follower counts.

You could rank programming languages by "popularity potential."

6. Correlation Heatmap
Possible Insights:

Strong positive correlations (e.g., followers ↔ stars, last year contributions ↔ followers).

Weak/no correlation between some fields (like social link vs followers, maybe).

Find what metrics are most important to predict popularity.

7. Joining Year vs Repository Numbers (Line/Trend Plot)
 Possible Insights:

You might see a downward trend if newer users create fewer repositories (due to competition).

Or an upward trend showing more users being productive faster.
